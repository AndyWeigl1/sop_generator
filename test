Hello! I would like some help with the attached project. I was implementing a new feature and The Claude chat experienced a time out and the implementation was incomplete. 

I've attached the markdown file of the implementation. I am fairly certain that steps 1, 3, 4, and 5 were implemented correctly, but step 2 (property panel) was not done. 

Can you please:

Help me with step 2 

make sure everything else is correctly implemented.
